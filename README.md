<h2> Part 1 of the project for Advanced BigData Systems 2020-2021 <h2>
<br>
Realise by Gilles Robin and Juliette Seimandi
 
<br>

<h3> Goals of the Project <h3>
<br>
 <p> The goal of this project is to apply some concepts & tools seen in the 3 parts of this course, this project is organized into 3 parts :</p>
<ol>
<li> Part 1 : Building Classical ML projects with respect to basic ML Coding best practices </li>
  
<li> Part 2 : Integrate MLFlow to your project </li>
  
<li> Part 3 : Integrate XAI (ML Interpretability with SHAP) to your project </li>

</ol>

<h3> Part 1 </h3>

<p>We use DataSet of Home credit risk classification in this project, you can find those dataset in https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data </p>
  
<p>Download application_train.csv and application_test.csv and put it in your home directory with allother file</p>

<p>You can find our load an analise of the data in the Import data and data cleaning.ipynb then our feature inginering with the creation of new and clean data set that will be used in our machine learning model</p>

<p>Then we build Xgboost, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting and improve all model</p> 
<br>
<h3> Sphinx Documentation </h3>
<br>
 <p>To have a better view of our model you can check our Sphinx documentation, to do so :</p>
<br>
<li> * Clone this git repositry </ li>
  <br>
<li> * launch a terminal </li>
  <br>
<li> * go to the git repository and launch the command <em> open build/html/index.html <em> </li>
   <br>
 <p>Then you will be abbale to understand all our project.</p>
